## **Description**
Champions League Gambling Simulator is a small interactive Python console game where the user selects one of 16 football teams and bets virtual credits on match outcomes. The program simulates a Champions-League–style knockout tournament, saves match results to an external file, and allows the user to view logs, check previous runs, and interact with the system through a menu-driven interface.

The program demonstrates modular decomposition, data storage, input validation, API usage, and console UI enhancements.

---------------------------------------

## **Purpose of the Program**
The purpose is to create a fun and interactive gambling-style experience while demonstrating the fundamental Python concepts required by the project:

- Using multiple modules and clean decomposition  
- Saving and retrieving data from files  
- Using lists, tuples, dicts, and sets  
- Data validation and error handling  
- API usage  
- Console menu navigation  
- Enhanced console display (colours, delays, text-based graphics)

---------------------------------------
